DOCKER-COMPOSE

We get services up and running .
We build them :
  . eg ngnix : define the service 
  . context: path to dockerfile
  . dockerfile : name of the dockerfile from which the image will be built
  . args: arguments passed from .env that will be avialble during the docker build image stage
  . image: name of the image
  . ports: ports we want to connect
  . environment : defined in the .env , these are available during execution
  . volumes: mounts the specified paths as volumes in the container 
      . ${WORDPRESS_VOLUME_PATH}:/var/www/html, this is called mapping 
        it helps keep persitance across container restarts.
      . ./nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx  Map logs to a host directory for easyer log access 
  . networks: connects service to this network
  . restart policy
  . depends on: create a dependency to ensure this dependecy service starts before
    service we are building
    . healthcheck: checks to see service is up and running
